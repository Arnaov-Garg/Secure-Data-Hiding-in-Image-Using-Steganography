# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **steganography** to securely hide data within images. By leveraging **advanced encoding techniques**, the data remains undetectable while preserving image quality.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy
- **Steganographic Methods:** LSB (Least Significant Bit), DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)

## ✨ Features
- 🔒 **Secure Data Hiding:** Advanced steganographic techniques.
- 🖼️ **Minimal Image Distortion:** Maintains high-quality visuals.
- 🔑 **Key-Based Access:** Only authorized users can decode hidden data.
- 🌍 **Real-World Applications:** Secure messaging, digital watermarking, and cybersecurity.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
#   Install dependencies:
   1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
3. Place an image mypic.jpg in project directory
